## Understanding the Problem Domain
* Teaching and learning are easier when you take away the problem domain
* Coding can be difficult if you can't see the big picture
* Knowing your problem domain can make it much easier to code
* Not knowing this makes it difficult to solve the problem
* Make life easier for yourself by focusing only on a particular part of a problem
* Make sure you understand a problem before you try to write the code
* Don't start coding right away if you haven't planned what you are going to do
