# SQL
* SQL stands for **Structured Query Language**
* A relational database is a collection of related two-dimensional tables
* SELECT statements are also known as **queries**
* `SELECT column FROM table`
* `WHERE` is added to include conditions on what to return, and you can add on conditionals `AND/OR`
* Operators:
  * `=, !=, <, >, <=, >=`
  * `BETWEEN...AND...`
  * `NOT BETWEEN...AND...`
  * `IN(column number)`
  * `NOT IN(column number)`
* You can update and add rows to a table with SQL
* You can also create an entirely new table
* Add a new column with  `ALTER TABLE`, and delete column with `DROP`
