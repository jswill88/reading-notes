# Trees

* The root is the top node in a tree
* Left child is the node positioned to the left of a root or node, and the right is on the right
* An edge is a link between a parent and child node
* A leaf is a childless node
* Height is the number of edges from the root to the bottommost node
### Depth First Traversal
* Pre-order goes root >> left >> right
* In-order goes left >> root >> right
* Post-order goes left >> right >> root
* Trees are most commonly traversed with recursion
* With recursion, you add nodes to the stack until you reach a leaf, and then that node will be called off the stack
* Nodes on each new level are treated as the root
* The basic function has three parts:
  1. Check if the is a root.left, if so call the function from that node
  1. Check if there is a root.right, and if so, call the function from that node
  1. Output the root value
* Whichever order you go in will still go to all the nodes, but in different orders
### Breadth First Traversal
* This goes down one layer at a time
* This uses a queue instead of recursion
* First put the root in the queue, then dequeue, but put the left and right child in the queue
* The do the same thing for the new nodes in the queue
* When a node in the queue does not have children, dequeue it without enqueueing anything new
### Binary Trees
* Each node can only have up to two children, but a binary tree can be of any size
* One strategy for adding nodes is to fill up bottom children from the top down
* The height of a binary tree is calculated as log(n), where n is the number of nodes
### Binary Search Trees
* In a BST, all nodes with a lower value than the root are on the left, and all nodes with a higher value are on the right
* Searches can be done quickly, because all you have to do is compare the number you are looking for with the number in the current root
* The time complexity for this is O(h), where h is the height of the tree
