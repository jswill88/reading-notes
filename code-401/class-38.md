# Redux - Asynchronous Actions 

__How granular should your reducers be?__  
There should be a separate reducer function for each slice of data. They are combined before being put into the store.  
https://redux.js.org/faq/reducers  
__Pro or Con - multiple reducers can "fire" when a commonly named action is dispatched__  
This is a Con because you may fire off reducers that you did not intend.  
__Name a strategy for preventing the above__  
You can use more specific names to make sure that the right action fires the right reducer at the correct time.
